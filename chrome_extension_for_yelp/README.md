# README

1. Enable developer mode in Chrome extensions
2. Load unpacked this folder
3. Go to yelp and click the extension

# Progress
Right now this extension only extracts reviews from the current yelp page and dumps it all on the popup.html.

# Next Steps
I am considering calling our python summarization API if I figure out how REST API works with Chrome extension. I may also look at how the UI can be displayed in based on other existing projects.
